        <h1>I am BossDaily</h1>
        <p>I am BossDaily, one of the greatest programmers to ever touch a computer. I program using pen and paper, I remember and then manually switch transistors. Compiliers? Languages? Only losers use those. I can make any program I can think of within 2 hours, I've made fully custom everything because I am afraid the government has a backdoor in everything. I live in a van and I travel america living off of fastfood, willpower, and github sponsorships.</p>
